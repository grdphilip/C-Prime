/* 
In C++, as in most programming languages, the type of an object determines what operations can be performed on it. 
Some languages, such as Smalltalk and Python, check types at run time. In contrast, C++ is a statically typed language; 
type checking is done at compile time. As a consequence, the compiler must know the type of every name used in the program.

Perhaps the most important feature in C++ is the class, which lets programmers define their own types. 
In C++ such types are some- times called “class types” to distinguish them from the types that are built into the language. 

Types are fundamental to any program: They tell us what our data mean and what operations we can perform on those data.
Different types are specified at 2.1.1
